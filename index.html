            The open, global internet is the most powerful communication and collaboration resource we have ever seen. 
            It embodies some of our deepest hopes for human progress. 
            It enables new opportunities for learning, building a sense of shared humanity, 
            and solving the pressing problems facing people everywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the last decade we have seen this promise fulfilled in many ways. 
            We have also seen the power of the internet used to magnify divisiveness, incite violence, 
            promote hatred, and intentionally manipulate fact and reality. 
            We have learned that we should more explicitly set out our aspirations for the human experience of the internet. 
            We do so now.
